                        <p>Defeasible reasoning is a kind of reasoning that is based on  reasons that are defeasible, as opposed to the indefeasible reasons of  deductive logic. Defeasible reasoning is a particular kind of non-demonstrative  reasoning, where the reasoning does not produce a full, complete, or final  demonstration of a claim, i.e., where fallibility and corrigibility of a  conclusion are acknowledged. In other words defeasible reasoning produces a  contingent statement or claim. Other kinds of non-demonstrative reasoning are  probabilistic reasoning, inductive reasoning, statistical reasoning, abductive  reasoning, and paraconsistent reasoning. Defeasible reasoning is also a kind of  ampliative reasoning because its conclusions reach beyond the pure meanings of  the premises.</p>
                        <p>The differences between these kinds of reasoning correspond  to differences about the conditional that each kind of reasoning uses, and on  what premise (or on what authority) the conditional is adopted:</p>
                        <p>Deductive (from  meaning postulate, axiom, or contingent assertion): if p then q (i.e., q or  not-p)<br>
                           Defeasible (from  authority): if p then (defeasibly) q<br>
                           Probabilistic  (from combinatorics and indifference): if p then (probably) q<br>
                           Statistical (from  data and presumption): the frequency of qs among ps is high (or inference from  a model fit to data); hence, (in the right context) if p then (probably) q<br>
                           Inductive (theory  formation; from data, coherence, simplicity, and confirmation): (inducibly)  &quot;if p then q&quot;; hence, if p then (deducibly-but-revisably) q<br>
                           Abductive (from  data and theory): p and q are correlated, and q is sufficient for p; hence, if  p then (abducibly) q as cause
                        </p>
                        <p>Some have thought that defeasible reasoning could be  connected to qualitative probabilistic reasoning, but such efforts have not  borne great insights.</p>
                        <p>Defeasible reasoning finds its fullest expression in  jurisprudence, ethics and moral philosophy, epistemology, pragmatics and  conversational conventions in linguistics, constructivist decision theories,  and in knowledge representation and planning in artificial intelligence. It is  also closely identified with prima facie (presumptive) reasoning (i.e.,  reasoning on the &quot;face&quot; of evidence), and ceteris paribus (default)  reasoning (i.e., reasoning, all things &quot;being equal&quot;).</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>Though Aristotle differentiated the forms of reasoning that  are valid for logic and philosophy from the more general ones that are used in  everyday life (see dialectics and rhetoric), 20th century philosophers mainly  concentrated on deductive reasoning. At the end of the 19th century, logic  texts would typically survey both demonstrative and non-demonstrative  reasoning, often giving more space to the latter. However, after the blossoming  of mathematical logic at the hands of Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead  and Willard van Orman Quine, latter-20th century logic texts paid little  attention to the non-deductive modes of inference.</p>
                        <p>There are several notable exceptions. John Maynard Keynes  wrote his dissertation on non-demonstrative reasoning, and influenced the  thinking of Ludwig Wittgenstein on this subject. Wittgenstein, in turn, had  many admirers, including the positivist legal scholar H.L.A. Hart and the  speech act linguist John L. Austin, Stephen Toulmin in rhetoric (Chaim Perelman  too), the moral theorists W.D. Ross and C.L. Stevenson, and the vagueness  epistemologist/ontologist Friedrich Waismann.</p>
                        <p>The etymology of defeasible usually refers to Middle English  law of contracts, where a condition of defeasance is a clause that can  invalidate or annul a contract or deed. Though defeat, dominate, defer, defy,  deprecate and derogate are often used in the same contexts as defeasible, the  verbs annul and invalidate (and nullify, overturn, rescind, vacate, repeal,  debar, void, cancel, countermand, preempt, etc.) are more properly correlated  with the concept of defeasibility than those words beginning with the letter d.  Many dictionaries do contain the verb, to defease with past participle,  defeased.</p>
                        <p>Philosophers in moral theory and rhetoric had taken  defeasibility largely for granted when American epistemologists rediscovered  Wittgenstein's thinking on the subject: John Ladd, Roderick Chisholm, Roderick  Firth, Ernest Sosa, Robert Nozick, and John L. Pollock all began writing with  new conviction about how appearance as red was only a defeasible reason for  believing something to be red. More importantly Wittgenstein's orientation  toward language-games (and away from semantics) emboldened these  epistemologists to manage rather than to expurgate prima facie logical  inconsistency.</p>
                        <p>At the same time (in the mid-1960s), two more students of  Hart and Austin at Oxford, Brian Barry and David Gauthier, were applying  defeasible reasoning to political argument and practical reasoning (of action),  respectively. Joel Feinberg and Joseph Raz were beginning to produce equally  mature works in ethics and jurisprudence informed by defeasibility.</p>
                        <p>By far the most significant works on defeasibility by the  mid-1970s were in epistemology, where John Pollock's 1974 Knowledge and  Justification popularized his terminology of undercutting and rebutting (which  mirrored the analysis of Toulmin). Pollock's work was significant precisely  because it brought defeasibility so close to philosophical logicians. The  failure of logicians to dismiss defeasibility in epistemology (as Cambridge's  logicians had done to Hart decades earlier) landed defeasible reasoning in the  philosophical mainstream.</p>
                        <p>Defeasibility had always been closely related to argument,  rhetoric, and law, except in epistemology, where the chains of reasons, and the  origin of reasons, were not often discussed. Nicholas Rescher's Dialectics is  an example of how difficult it was for philosophers to contemplate more complex  systems of defeasible reasoning. This was in part because proponents of  informal logic became the keepers of argument and rhetoric while insisting that  formalism was anathema to argument.</p>
                        <p>About this time, researchers in artificial intelligence  became interested in non-monotonic reasoning and its semantics. With  philosophers such as Pollock and Donald Nute (e.g., defeasible logic), dozens  of computer scientists and logicians produced complex systems of defeasible  reasoning between 1980 and 2000. No single system of defeasible reasoning would  emerge in the same way that Quine's system of logic became a de facto standard.  Nevertheless, the 100-year headstart on non-demonstrative logical calculi, due  to George Boole, Charles Sanders Peirce, and Gottlob Frege was being closed:  both demonstrative and non-demonstrative reasoning now have formal calculi.</p>
                        <p>There are related (and slightly competing) systems of  reasoning that are newer than systems of defeasible reasoning, e.g., belief  revision and dynamic logic. The dialogue logics of Charles Hamblin and Jim  Mackenzie (logician), and their colleagues, can also be tied closely to  defeasible reasoning. Belief revision is a non-constructive specification of  the desiderata with which, or constraints according to which, epistemic change  takes place. Dynamic logic is related mainly because, like paraconsistent  logic, the reordering of premises can change the set of justified conclusions. Dialogue  logics introduce an adversary, but are like belief revision theories in their  adherence to deductively consistent states of belief.</p>

                           <hr>
                        </header>
                        <p>Many political philosophers have been fond of the word  indefeasible when referring to rights, e.g., that were inalienable, divine, or  indubitable. For example, in the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights,  &quot;community hath an indubitable, inalienable, and indefeasible right to  reform, alter or abolish government...&quot; (also attributed to James  Madison); and John Adams, &quot;The people have a right, an indisputable,  unalienable, indefeasible, divine right to that most dreaded and envied kind of  knowledge - I mean of the character and conduct of their rulers.&quot; Also,  Lord Aberdeen: &quot;indefeasible right inherent in the British Crown&quot; and  Gouverneur Morris: &quot;the Basis of our own Constitution is the indefeasible  Right of the People.&quot; Scholarship about Abraham Lincoln often cites these  passages in the justification of secession. Philosophers who use the word  defeasible have historically had different world views from those who use the  word indefeasible (and this distinction has often been mirrored by Oxford and  Cambridge zeitgeist); hence it is rare to find authors who use both words.</p>
                        <p>In judicial opinions, the use of defeasible is commonplace.  There is however disagreement among legal logicians whether defeasible  reasoning is central, e.g., in the consideration of open texture, precedent,  exceptions, and rationales, or whether it applies only to explicit defeasance  clauses. H.L.A. Hart in The Concept of Law gives two famous examples of  defeasibility: &quot;No vehicles in the park&quot; (except during parades); and  &quot;Offer, acceptance, and memorandum produce a contract&quot; (except when  the contract is illegal, the parties are minors, inebriated, or incapacitated,  etc.).</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>One of the main disputes among those who produce systems of defeasible reasoning is the status of a rule of specificity. In its simplest form, it is the same rule as subclass inheritance preempting class inheritance:</p>

                           Approximately half of the systems of defeasible reasoning discussed today adopt a rule of specificity, while half expect that such preference rules be written explicitly by whoever provides the defeasible reasons. For example, Rescher's dialectical system uses specificity, as do early systems of multiple inheritance (e.g., David Touretzky) and the early argument systems of Donald Nute and of Guillermo Simari and Ronald Loui. Defeasible reasoning accounts of precedent (stare decisis and case-based reasoning) also make use of specificity (e.g., Joseph Raz and the work of Kevin D. Ashley and Edwina Rissland). Meanwhile, the argument systems of Henry Prakken and Giovanni Sartor, of Bart Verheij and Jaap Hage, and the system of Phan Minh Dung do not adopt such a rule.

                           <h3>Nature of defeasibility</h3>
                           <hr>
                        </header>
                        <p>There is a distinct difference between those who theorize  about defeasible reasoning as if it were a system of confirmational revision  (with affinities to belief revision), and those who theorize about  defeasibility as if it were the result of further (non-empirical)  investigation. There are at least three kinds of further non-empirical  investigation: progress in a lexical/syntactic process, progress in a  computational process, and progress in an adversary or legal proceeding.</p>
                        <p>Defeasibility as corrigibility: Here, a person learns  something new that annuls a prior inference. In this case, defeasible reasoning  provides a constructive mechanism for belief revision, like a truth maintenance  system as envisioned by Jon Doyle.</p>
                        <p>Defeasibility as shorthand for preconditions: Here, the  author of a set of rules or legislative code is writing rules with exceptions.  Sometimes a set of defeasible rules can be rewritten, with more cogency, with  explicit (local) pre-conditions instead of (non-local) competing rules. Many  non-monotonic systems with fixed-point or preferential semantics fit this view.  However, sometimes the rules govern a process of argument (the last view on  this list), so that they cannot be re-compiled into a set of deductive rules  lest they lose their force in situations with incomplete knowledge or  incomplete derivation of preconditions.</p>
                        <p>Defeasibility as an anytime algorithm: Here, it is assumed  that calculating arguments takes time, and at any given time, based on a subset  of the potentially constructible arguments, a conclusion is defeasibly  justified. Isaac Levi has protested against this kind of defeasibility, but it  is well-suited to the heuristic projects of, for example, Herbert A. Simon. On  this view, the best move so far in a chess-playing program's analysis at a  particular depth is a defeasibly justified conclusion. This interpretation  works with either the prior or the next semantical view.</p>
                        <p>Defeasibility as a means of controlling an investigative or  social process: Here, justification is the result of the right kind of  procedure (e.g., a fair and efficient hearing), and defeasible reasoning  provides impetus for pro and con responses to each other. Defeasibility has to  do with the alternation of verdict as locutions are made and cases presented,  not the changing of a mind with respect to new (empirical) discovery. Under  this view, defeasible reasoning and defeasible argumentation refer to the same  phenomenon.</p>
