               <hr>
               <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
               <img src="headImg.png" width="1090" height="61" alt="headerImage">
               <p><strong>Defeasible reasoning</strong> is a kind of <a href="#">reasoning</a> that is based on reasons that are <a href="#"><em>defeasible</em></a>, as opposed to the indefeasible reasons of deductive logic. Defeasible reasoning is a particular kind of non-demonstrative reasoning, where the reasoning does not produce a full, complete, or final demonstration of a claim, i.e., where fallibility and corrigibility of a conclusion are acknowledged. In other words defeasible reasoning produces a <a href="#">contingent</a> statement or claim. Other kinds of non-demonstrative reasoning are <a href="#">probabilistic reasoning</a>, <a href="#">inductive reasoning</a>, <a href="#">statistical</a> reasoning, <a href="#">abductive reasoning</a>, and <a href="#">paraconsistent</a> reasoning. Defeasible reasoning is also a kind of <a href="#">ampliative</a> reasoning because its conclusions reach beyond the pure meanings of the premises.</p>
               <p>The differences between these kinds of reasoning correspond to differences about the conditional that each kind of reasoning uses, and on what premise (or on what authority) the conditional is adopted:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li><em><a href="#">Deductive</a></em> (from meaning postulate, axiom, or contingent assertion): if <em>p</em> then <em>q</em> (i.e., <em>q</em> or <em>not-p</em>)</li>
                  <li><em>Defeasible</em> (from authority): if <em>p</em> then (defeasibly) <em>q</em></li>
                  <li><em><a href="#">Probabilistic</a></em> (from combinatorics and indifference): if <em>p</em> then (probably) <em>q</em></li>
                  <li><em><a href="#">Statistical</a></em> (from data and presumption): the frequency of <em>qs</em> among <em>ps</em> is high (or inference from a model fit to data); hence, (in the right context) if <em>p</em> then (probably) <em>q</em>
                  <li><em><a href="#">Inductive</a></em> (theory formation; from data, coherence, simplicity, and confirmation): (inducibly) "if <em>p</em> then <em>q</em>"; hence, if <em>p</em> then (deducibly-but-revisably) <em>q</em></li>
                  <li><em><a href="#">Abductive</a></em> (from data and theory): <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> are correlated, and q is sufficient for <em>p</em>; hence, if <em>p</em> then (abducibly) <em>q</em> as cause</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Some have thought that defeasible reasoning could be connected to qualitative probabilistic reasoning, but such efforts have not borne great insights.</p>
               <p>Defeasible reasoning finds its fullest expression in jurisprudence, ethics and moral philosophy, epistemology, pragmatics and conversational conventions in linguistics, constructivist decision theories, and in knowledge representation and planning in artificial intelligence. It is also closely identified with prima facie (presumptive) reasoning (i.e., reasoning on the "face" of evidence), and ceteris paribus (default) reasoning (i.e., reasoning, all things "being equal").</p>

               <h2>History</h2>
               <hr>
               <p>Though <a href="#" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> differentiated the forms of reasoning that are valid for <a href="#" title="Logic">logic</a> and <a href="#" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> from the more general ones that are used in everyday life (see <a href="#" title="Dialectics" >dialectics</a> and <a href="#" title="Rhetoric">rhetoric</a>), 20th century philosophers mainly concentrated on deductive reasoning. At the end of the 19th century, logic texts would typically survey both demonstrative and non-demonstrative reasoning, often giving more space to the latter. However, after the blossoming of <a href="#" title="Mathematical logic">mathematical logic</a> at the hands of <a href="#" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>, <a href="#" title="Alfred North Whitehead">Alfred North Whitehead</a> and <a href="#" title="Willard van Orman Quine" >Willard van Orman Quine</a>, latter-20th century logic texts paid little attention to the non-deductive modes of inference.</p>
               <p>There are several notable exceptions. <a href="#" title="John Maynard Keynes">John Maynard Keynes</a> wrote his dissertation on non-demonstrative reasoning, and influenced the thinking of <a href="#" title="Ludwig Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> on this subject. Wittgenstein, in turn, had many admirers, including the <a href="#" title="Positivist" >positivist</a> legal scholar <a href="#" title="H.L.A. Hart" >H.L.A. Hart</a> and the <a href="#" title="Speech act">speech act</a> linguist <a href="#" title="John L. Austin" >John L. Austin</a>, <a href="#" title="Stephen Toulmin">Stephen Toulmin</a> in rhetoric (<a href="#" title="Chaim Perelman" >Chaim Perelman</a> too), the moral theorists <a href="#" title="W.D. Ross" >W.D. Ross</a> and <a href="#" title="C.L. Stevenson" >C.L. Stevenson</a>, and the <a href="#" title="Vagueness">vagueness</a> epistemologist/ontologist <a href="#" title="Friedrich Waismann">Friedrich Waismann</a>.</p>
               <p>The etymology of <i>defeasible</i> usually refers to Middle English law of contracts, where a condition of defeasance is a clause that can invalidate or annul a contract or deed. Though <i>defeat</i>, <i>dominate</i>, <i>defer</i>, <i>defy</i>, <i>deprecate</i> and <i>derogate</i> are often used in the same contexts as <i>defeasible,</i> the verbs <i>annul</i> and <i>invalidate</i> (and <i>nullify,</i> <i>overturn,</i> <i>rescind,</i> <i>vacate,</i> <i>repeal,</i> <i>debar</i>, <i>void</i>, <i>cancel</i>, <i>countermand</i>, <i>preempt</i>, etc.) are more properly correlated with the concept of defeasibility than those words beginning with the letter <i>d</i>. Many dictionaries do contain the verb, <i>to defease</i> with past participle, <i>defeased.</i></p>
               <p>Philosophers in moral theory and rhetoric had taken defeasibility largely for granted when American epistemologists rediscovered Wittgenstein's thinking on the subject: <a href="#" class="new" title="John Ladd (page does not exist)">John Ladd</a>, <a href="#" title="Roderick Chisholm">Roderick Chisholm</a>, <a href="#" title="Roderick Firth">Roderick Firth</a>, <a href="#" title="Ernest Sosa">Ernest Sosa</a>, <a href="#" title="Robert Nozick">Robert Nozick</a>, and <a href="#" title="John L. Pollock">John L. Pollock</a> all began writing with new conviction about how <i>appearance as red</i> was only a defeasible reason for believing something to be red. More importantly Wittgenstein's orientation toward <a href="#" title="Language-games" >language-games</a> (and away from <a href="#" title="Semantics">semantics</a>) emboldened these epistemologists to manage rather than to expurgate <i>prima facie</i> logical inconsistency.</p>
               <p>At the same time (in the mid-1960s), two more students of Hart and Austin at Oxford, <a href="#" title="Brian Barry">Brian Barry</a> and <a href="#" title="David Gauthier">David Gauthier</a>, were applying defeasible reasoning to political argument and practical reasoning (of action), respectively. <a href="#" title="Joel Feinberg">Joel Feinberg</a> and <a href="#" title="Joseph Raz">Joseph Raz</a> were beginning to produce equally mature works in ethics and jurisprudence informed by defeasibility.</p>
               <p>By far the most significant works on defeasibility by the mid-1970s were in epistemology, where <a href="#" title="John L. Pollock">John Pollock</a>'s 1974 <i>Knowledge and Justification</i> popularized his terminology of <i>undercutting</i> and <i>rebutting</i> (which mirrored the analysis of Toulmin). Pollock's work was significant precisely because it brought defeasibility so close to philosophical logicians. The failure of logicians to dismiss defeasibility in epistemology (as Cambridge's logicians had done to Hart decades earlier) landed defeasible reasoning in the philosophical mainstream.</p>
               <p>Defeasibility had always been closely related to argument, rhetoric, and law, except in epistemology, where the chains of reasons, and the origin of reasons, were not often discussed. <a href="#" title="Nicholas Rescher">Nicholas Rescher</a>'s <i>Dialectics</i> is an example of how difficult it was for philosophers to contemplate more complex systems of defeasible reasoning. This was in part because proponents of <a href="#" title="Informal logic">informal logic</a> became the keepers of argument and rhetoric while insisting that formalism was anathema to argument.</p>
               <p>About this time, researchers in <a href="#" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> became interested in <a href="#" title="Non-monotonic reasoning" >non-monotonic reasoning</a> and its <a href="#" title="Semantics">semantics</a>. With philosophers such as Pollock and <a href="#" class="new" title="Donald Nute (page does not exist)">Donald Nute</a> (e.g., <a href="#" title="Defeasible logic">defeasible logic</a>), dozens of computer scientists and logicians produced complex systems of defeasible reasoning between 1980 and 2000. No single system of defeasible reasoning would emerge in the same way that Quine's system of logic became a de facto standard. Nevertheless, the 100-year headstart on non-demonstrative logical calculi, due to <a href="#" title="George Boole">George Boole</a>, <a href="#" title="Charles Sanders Peirce">Charles Sanders Peirce</a>, and <a href="#" title="Gottlob Frege">Gottlob Frege</a> was being closed: both demonstrative and non-demonstrative reasoning now have formal calculi.</p>
               <p>There are related (and slightly competing) systems of reasoning that are newer than systems of defeasible reasoning, e.g., <a href="/wiki/Belief_revision" title="Belief revision">belief revision</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dynamic_logic_(modal_logic)" title="Dynamic logic (modal logic)">dynamic logic</a>. The <a href="#" class="new" title="Dialogue logics (page does not exist)">dialogue logics</a> of <a href="#" title="Charles Leonard Hamblin">Charles Hamblin</a> and <a href="#"  title="Jim Mackenzie (logician) (page does not exist)">Jim Mackenzie (logician)</a>, and their colleagues, can also be tied closely to defeasible reasoning. Belief revision is a non-constructive specification of the desiderata with which, or constraints according to which, epistemic change takes place. Dynamic logic is related mainly because, like paraconsistent logic, the reordering of premises can change the set of justified conclusions. Dialogue logics introduce an adversary, but are like belief revision theories in their adherence to deductively consistent states of belief.</p>

               <h2>Political and judicial use</h2>
               <hr>
               <p>Many political philosophers have been fond of the word <i>indefeasible</i> when referring to rights, e.g., that were <i>inalienable,</i> <i>divine,</i> or <i>indubitable.</i> For example, in the 1776 <a href="#" title="Virginia Declaration of Rights">Virginia Declaration of Rights</a>, "community hath an indubitable, inalienable, and indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish government..." (also attributed to <a href="#" title="James Madison">James Madison</a>); and <a href="#" title="John Adams">John Adams</a>, "The people have a right, an indisputable, unalienable, indefeasible, divine right to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge - I mean of the character and conduct of their rulers." Also, <a href="#" title="Lord Aberdeen" >Lord Aberdeen</a>: "indefeasible right inherent in the British Crown" and <a href="#" title="Gouverneur Morris">Gouverneur Morris</a>: "the Basis of our own Constitution is the indefeasible Right of the People." Scholarship about <a href="#" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> often cites these passages in the justification of secession. Philosophers who use the word <i>defeasible</i> have historically had different world views from those who use the word <i>indefeasible</i> (and this distinction has often been mirrored by Oxford and Cambridge zeitgeist); hence it is rare to find authors who use both words.</p>
               <p>There are related (and slightly competing) systems of reasoning that are newer than systems of defeasible reasoning, e.g., <a href="#" title="Belief revision">belief revision</a> and <a href="#" title="Dynamic logic (modal logic)">dynamic logic</a>. The <a href="#" class="new" title="Dialogue logics (page does not exist)">dialogue logics</a> of <a href="#" title="Charles Leonard Hamblin">Charles Hamblin</a> and <a href="#" class="new" title="Jim Mackenzie (logician) (page does not exist)">Jim Mackenzie (logician)</a>, and their colleagues, can also be tied closely to defeasible reasoning.

                  <pre>
 (R1) if <i>p</i> then (defeasibly) <i>q</i>                  e.g., if penguin then not-flies
 (R2) if <i>r</i> then (defeasibly) <i>not-q</i>              e.g., if bird then flies
 (O1) if <i>p</i> then (deductively) <i>r</i>                 e.g., if penguin then bird
 (M1) arguably, p                               e.g., arguably, penguin
 (M2) R1 is a more specific reason than R2      e.g., R1 is better than R2
 (M3) therefore, arguably, q                    e.g., therefore, arguably, not-flies
</pre>
               </div>
               <p>Approximately half of the systems of defeasible reasoning discussed today adopt a rule of specificity, while half expect that such <i>preference</i> rules be written explicitly by whoever provides the defeasible reasons. For example, Rescher's dialectical system uses specificity, as do early systems of multiple inheritance (e.g., <a href="#" title="David Touretzky" >David Touretzky</a>) and the early argument systems of <a href="#" title="Donald Nute (page does not exist)">Donald Nute</a> and of <a href="#" title="Guillermo Simari">Guillermo Simari</a> and <a href="#" title="Ronald Loui">Ronald Loui</a>. Defeasible reasoning accounts of precedent (<a href="#" title="Stare decisis" >stare decisis</a> and <a href="#" title="Case-based reasoning">case-based reasoning</a>) also make use of specificity (e.g., <a href="#" title="Joseph Raz">Joseph Raz</a> and the work of <a href="#" title="Kevin D. Ashley (page does not exist)">Kevin D. Ashley</a> and <a href="#" title="Edwina Rissland (page does not exist)">Edwina Rissland</a>). Meanwhile, the argument systems of <a href="#" class="new" title="Henry Prakken (page does not exist)">Henry Prakken</a> and <a href="#" title="Giovanni Sartor (page does not exist)">Giovanni Sartor</a>, of <a href="#" title="Bart Verheij (page does not exist)">Bart Verheij</a> and <a href="#" title="Jaap Hage (page does not exist)">Jaap Hage</a>, and the system of <a href="#" title="Phan Minh Dung (page does not exist)">Phan Minh Dung</a> do not adopt such a rule.</p>

               <h2>Nature of defeasibility</h2>
               <hr>
               <p>There is a distinct difference between those who theorize about defeasible reasoning as if it were a system of confirmational revision (with affinities to <a href="" title="Belief revision">belief revision</a>), and those who theorize about defeasibility as if it were the result of further (non-empirical) investigation. There are at least three kinds of further non-empirical investigation: progress in a lexical/syntactic process, progress in a computational process, and progress in an adversary or legal proceeding.</p>
               <p><i><b>Defeasibility as corrigibility:</b></i> Here, a person learns something new that annuls a prior inference. In this case, defeasible reasoning provides a constructive mechanism for belief revision, like a <a href="#" title="Truth maintenance system" >truth maintenance system</a> as envisioned by Jon Doyle.</p>
               <p><i><b>Defeasibility as shorthand for preconditions:</b></i> Here, the author of a set of rules or legislative code is writing rules with exceptions. Sometimes a set of defeasible rules can be rewritten, with more cogency, with explicit (local) pre-conditions instead of (non-local) competing rules. Many non-monotonic systems with <a href="#" title="Fixed point (mathematics)">fixed-point</a> or <a href="#" title="Preferential" >preferential</a> semantics fit this view. However, sometimes the rules govern a process of argument (the last view on this list), so that they cannot be re-compiled into a set of deductive rules lest they lose their force in situations with incomplete knowledge or incomplete derivation of preconditions.</p>
               <p><i><b>Defeasibility as an <a href="#" title="Anytime algorithm">anytime algorithm</a>:</b></i> Here, it is assumed that calculating arguments takes time, and at any given time, based on a subset of the potentially constructible arguments, a conclusion is defeasibly justified. <a href="#" title="Isaac Levi">Isaac Levi</a> has protested against this kind of defeasibility, but it is well-suited to the heuristic projects of, for example, <a href="#" title="Herbert A. Simon">Herbert A. Simon</a>. On this view, the <i>best move so far</i> in a chess-playing program's analysis at a particular depth is a defeasibly justified conclusion. This interpretation works with either the prior or the next semantical view.</p>
               <p><i><b>Defeasibility as a means of controlling an investigative or social process:</b></i> Here, justification is the result of the right kind of procedure (e.g., a fair and efficient hearing), and defeasible reasoning provides impetus for pro and con responses to each other. Defeasibility has to do with the alternation of verdict as locutions are made and cases presented, not the changing of a mind with respect to new (empirical) discovery. Under this view, defeasible reasoning and defeasible argumentation refer to the same phenomenon.</p>
